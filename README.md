# COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization

![COVID-19 Dashboard](/images/covid19_dashboard_banner.png)

## Overview

This repository houses a comprehensive project for analyzing and visualizing global COVID-19 data. The project covers various stages, including data collection, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the creation of an interactive dashboard. Leveraging the COVID-19 dataset from Johns Hopkins University, this project aims to provide insights into the global impact of the pandemic.
